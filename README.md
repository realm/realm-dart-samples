# Realm Dart Samples

This repo contains Flutter and Dart samples that demonstate the usage of [Realm Flutter and Realm Dart SDKs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/).

To build your own app with Realm, use the [realm](https://pub.dev/packages/realm) package for Flutter and the [realm_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart) package for Dart applications.

The Realm Flutter and Dart SDK repository is located at https://github.com/realm/realm-dart

You may find the [Quick Start - Flutter SDK]( https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/quick-start/) helpful if you are using Realm for the first time.
To learn more about using Realm with Atlas App Services, refer to the [Atlas Device Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/sync/) and [connecting to Atlas App Services](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/app-services/) documentation.

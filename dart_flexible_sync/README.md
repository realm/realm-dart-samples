# Dart Flexible Sync sample

A Dart console application using [Realm Dart SDK](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/#dart-standalone-realm) Flexible Sync with [Atlas App Services application](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/).

This sample demonstrates the usage of [Atlas Device Sync with Flexible Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/flutter/sync/) and the Realm Dart SDK.

Writing to a synced realm sends the data automatically to a linked collection in MongoDB Atlas. The synced realm is subscribed to a query only for items matching specific criteria.
This causes the synced realm to be populated only with specific items matching the query.
Items in the MongoDB collection on Atlas that do not match the query do not sync to the client device.

## Realm Dart SDK

Realm Dart package is published to [realm_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart).

## Environment setup for Realm Dart

* Realm Dart supports Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.

* Dart SDK ^2.17.5 or newer

## Atlas App Services Configuration Steps

### Using existing demo App Service

This sample is using an already prepared Atlas App Service with AppID `dart_flexible_sync-mdyyd`.
The app_id is configured in "\atlas_app\realm_config.json"

### Creating a new App Service

If you want to create an Atlas App Service and have an access to the cloud App, follow the instruction below.

1. Create an account on [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com). Follow the instructions: [Register a new Atlas Account](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-atlas-account/#register-a-new-service-account).

#### Using Realm CLI

1. Create an App using [realm-cli](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/cli/#mongodb-binary-bin.realm-cli).
1. Open command line terminal and go to the root folder of this Flutter app.
1. Install `realm-cli` following the [instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/cli/#mongodb-binary-bin.realm-cli).

    `npm install -g mongodb-realm-cli`

1. Login to the realm-cli:

    `realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"`

1. Go into folder '\atlas_app':

    `cd atlas_app`

1. Deploy the app to Atlas App Services:
* IMPORTANT: Before pushing the app make sure the cluster name is the same like the cluster in your account. Go to "\atlas_app\data_sources\mongodb-atlas\config.json" and set the json field `clusterName`.
Then run this command:

    `realm-cli push --yes`

#### Using App Services UI

1. Create a new app following the instructions here: [Create an App with Atlas App Services UI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/manage-apps/create/create-with-realm-ui).
    For the purpose of this sample you don't need to create an app from a template. You can just create an empty application.
1. Go to the **Authentication** menu in the left panel and make sure the option "Allow users to log in anonymously" under `Authentication providers` tab is ON. Save and then click the button **Review draft & deploy**. Read [Authentication Providers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/authentication/providers/) for more information about the other authentication types.
1. Go to the **Rules** menu and select "Default roles and filters" under the service name. Choose `readAndWriteAll` and click the button **Add preset role**. Click the button **Save draft** and confirm. Then click the button **Review draft & deploy**.

1. Go to the **Device Sync** menu and [Enable Flexible Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/configure/enable-sync/#enable-flexible-sync).
    * Don't create a schema. Skip it by choosing "No thanks, continue to Sync".
    * Press the "Flexible Sync" button. Only Flexible Sync is supported in the Realm Dart SDK.
    * Switch ON the ["Development mode"](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/data-model/development-mode/) option.
    * Create a new database collection and choose a name for it.
    * The queryable fields used for filtering data between two realms in this application and they will be [automatically created in development mode](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/configure/sync-settings/#queryable-fields), because they are used in the sync subscriptions.
    * You can also create them manually from the UI. For this sample the fields are `status` and `progressMinutes`.
        Type the field name `status` in the selection box and then choose `Create status`.
        It will be created.
        Do the same for the field `progressMinutes`.
    * Click the button **Enable Sync** and confirm.
    * Click the button **Review draft & deploy**, again.
1. [Find and Copy the App ID](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/reference/find-your-project-or-app-id/) of your new application.
1. Go to `\atlas_app\realm_config.json` in this sample and set your app_Id as follow:
    ```json{
    { .....
      "app_id": "dart_flexible_sync-nxkdq"
      .....
    }
    ```
These steps are for the purpose of the sample. You can follow the instructions in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas) for more advanced and secured configurations.

## Usage

* Get dart packages for the application.

    ```
    dart pub get
    ```

* Install the `realm_dart` package into the application. This downloads and copies the required native binaries to the app directory.

    ```
    dart pub get
    dart run realm_dart install
    ```

*  Run the application

    ```
    dart run
    ```

* Check the data and schema in you Atlas collection.
    * Login in [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) with your account.
    * Go to your application and open **Schema** menu. You can see the newly created JSON schema 
        that represents your data model defined in `model.dart` file in this sample. 
        For more details [see](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/schemas/?_ga=2.267468942.1225817147.1654079983-1571915642.1647002315&_gac=1.216786660.1654173423.CjwKCAjwv-GUBhAzEiwASUMm4jBtzETN-YJq0KELgeGLKk-4_6wVAfImtPoBbo-A35_eKjZ1p0Lh_BoCotcQAvD_BwE)
    * Go to Atlass and [browse the collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/collections/#view-collections). All the tasks objects should be listed there.
